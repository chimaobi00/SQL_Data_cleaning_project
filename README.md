### Project overview

#### In this project, I embarked on a comprehensive data cleaning endeavor, leveraging SQL and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to preprocess a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset encapsulates layoff data spanning from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to the present, offering insights into the evolving dynamics of workforce disruptions during this tumultuous period. My primary objective was to meticulously cleanse the dataset, beginning with the removal of duplicate records, followed by standardization of data formats, handling of null values, and elimination of unwanted columns. This project underscores the critical role of data preparation in facilitating robust analysis and extracting meaningful insights from raw datasets.

### Data Sources

I found this data set on kaggle. And this is the link: kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022

### Tools
 Sql Management Server

### Context:

The dataset obtained from Kaggle provides a snapshot of layoffs and workforce reductions observed across various industries since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the global economy grappling with unprecedented challenges, understanding the trends and patterns in workforce dynamics is imperative for stakeholders ranging from policymakers to business leaders. By delving into this dataset, I aimed to uncover nuanced insights that shed light on the impact of the pandemic on employment trends and organizational responses across different sectors.

### Data Cleaning Methodology:

Duplicate Removal:
The initial step involved identifying and eliminating duplicate records within the dataset. Leveraging SQL queries, I meticulously scanned the dataset for duplicate entries based on key identifiers such as employee IDs or company names. By removing duplicate records, I ensured the accuracy and integrity of the dataset, mitigating the risk of redundant information skewing the analysis.
Standardization of Data Formats:
Standardizing data formats was crucial for ensuring consistency and compatibility across different variables. Using SQL queries, I standardized date formats, categorical variables, and other pertinent data elements. This standardization process not only enhanced data quality but also facilitated seamless integration and analysis across diverse datasets and platforms.
Handling Null Values:
Null values pose a significant challenge in data analysis, potentially skewing results and hindering insights generation. Employing SQL queries and CTEs, I systematically addressed null values by either imputing missing data based on logical assumptions or removing observations with substantial missing information. This meticulous approach ensured the completeness and reliability of the dataset, enhancing its suitability for in-depth analysis.
Elimination of Unwanted Columns:
Streamlining the dataset involved identifying and removing unnecessary columns that did not contribute to the intended analysis. Through SQL queries, I pruned the dataset, retaining only the essential variables relevant to the study objectives. This process not only reduced data redundancy but also optimized computational resources, facilitating efficient analysis and visualization.
Outcome and Impact:

The culmination of these data cleaning efforts yielded a refined and standardized dataset, poised for robust analysis and insights generation. By harnessing the power of SQL and CTEs, I transformed raw, unstructured data into a reliable resource for exploring employment trends, organizational responses, and socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This project exemplifies my proficiency in data cleaning methodologies and underscores my commitment to leveraging data-driven approaches to unravel complex real-world phenomena.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the data cleaning project undertaken using SQL for the layoff dataset from Kaggle underscores the pivotal role of data preparation in enabling informed decision-making and actionable insights extraction. By meticulously removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, handling null values, and eliminating unwanted columns, I ensured the integrity, accuracy, and usability of the dataset for subsequent analysis. This project exemplifies my expertise as a data analyst and showcases my ability to derive valuable insights from raw datasets, contributing to a deeper understanding of socio-economic phenomena amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
